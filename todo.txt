Todo:

    [ ] -> ECS 
        [x] -> {!} Created systems should take eventAggregator as an import,
        [ ] -> {!} Component types for system should be defined in system class not when creating one,

    [ ] -> UIManager,
        [x] -> Button
            [x] -> create button for game,
            [x] -> add additional event on button -> hover, pressed, released,
            [x] -> add additional property that will filter what events should send button (not all button will send hover events);
        [ ] -> Input
            [ ] -> create basic input component,
            [ ] -> events buttonslike logic (events: hover, focus, blur, out, changed), 


        [x] -> add shadow root for gameUI component
        [ ] -> documentation,

    [ ] -> {!} Sprite add total number of frames,
        
    [ ] -> Animation Manager,
        [ ] -> unit tests


    [ ] -> Debugging tools,
        [] -> Debug drawing tools,

    [ ] -> AssetsLoader,
        [  ] -> Asset base class -> Texture class, Sound class,
        [  ] -> Loading texture to game,
        [  ] -> Loading sounds to game,
        [  ] -> Getting access for textures and sounds from other parts of game,
        [  ] -> Texture/sound metadata,
        [  ] -> Test AssetsLoader with GraphicManager,
        [  ] -> Some kind of progress information -> "LOADED/INITIAL", "LOADING {0}" ({0} -> stands for percentage of loaded files),
    [ ] -> SceneManager
        [ ] -> unit tests for SceneManager,
    [ ] -> InputManager
        [ ] -> unit tests for InputManager,
    [ ] -> SoundManager
        [ ] -> unit tests for SoundManager,
    [ ] -> importing and exporting state from ECS,

ToDo_v2:

    [ ] -> Animation manager - angle animation:
        [ ] -> increase animation not from - to,
        [ ] -> change step (not fluid but change angle f.e by 2 degrees)

    [ ] -> ECS,
        [ ] -> Pasue/resume functions,
        [ ] -> Get entity reference by entityId,
        [ ] -> Way of creating component that has to be an interface,

    [ ] -> Join points werid position

So the UI manager will have to work seperatly from ECS. I would like to use ECS as separate concept and only communicate with it by events? Dunno exactly how then connect it with input events. I think the ECS should have some kind of getting specific entity outside system so different Managers could do some work on them f.e. 

Input management + UI management + ECS:

- for player controlled entities (example) :
    0. StateManager is in "Play state",
    1. User presses "UP_ARROW",
    2. InputManager recives this and sets correct flag to true,
    3. ECS gives StateManager reference for player playerControlledComponent,
    4. StateManager changes playerControlledComponent state from 'stand' to 'go_up',
    5. Systems recives it and updates playerEntity correctly? 

- for ui components that changes state of ecs components (example) :
    0. StateManager is in "Play state",
    1. User presses "I" key (or button on screen),
    2. ECS "pauses" (or not),
    3. UI EventListener for this button or letter is launched so Equipment grid is now 'visible',
    4. User select one item from equipment and removes it from bag,
    5. UI Manager get entity that has some kind of equipment component and then removes information about item,
    6. User pressed "Esc" key (or again button on screen),
    7. ECS "unpause" (or not if in step 2 was not paused)

CONCLUSION -> 
    - ECS pause/resume state -> it should finish it cycle and then stop untill it's resumed,
    - ECS need to have some kind of getting entity by ID method (entityId is unique and returned with ECS.addEntity method),
    - InputManager will need to have separation of either updating game component or ui manager component,

CONCERNS ->
    - How to separate InputManager + ECS + UIManager, I don't want to make them binded thightly together.
